# The Coffee Machine

## Goal
The goal of this project is to create a web app which will be embedded in our new model of vending coffee machine called "Miracle".

We have a limited time to complete this project. We trust you to achieve this work.

This project should contain the following:
- A view to list the drinks available
- A view to display the details for a drink
- An admin view to manage drinks: create / modify / delete
- automatic tests (unit test, integration test)

[Here the final design we received from the design team](https://www.figma.com/file/BHv0tZg266zUCvwtPzAAsU/The-Coffee-Machine?node-id=0%3A1&t=LrcLV1j51YEOGdUx-1)

## Comments

Please time yourself on the project to give us an idea of your performance since we might need your service for another project.
We are also interested in understanding which shortcuts you take when performing under pressure.
We always advise planning moves to achieve the project before jumping in coding.

Once the project is completed, create a pull request from your fork and add me as a reviewer.

# Details Step for beginners

- Create a new folder
- Install Flask
- Look at the doc to find a simple flask example to create a view and display some html
